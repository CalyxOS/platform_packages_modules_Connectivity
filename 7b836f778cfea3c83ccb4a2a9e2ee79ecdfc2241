      "message": "A side effect of having the lockdown state incorporated into getVpnIsolationInterface\u0027s determination is that, because lockdown state is not tracked, we cannot know what the value for getVpnIsolationInterface was for a given network at a given time. Sadly, this means we cannot use the past state to skip unnecessary steps anymore, *or* to know what interface was used for a network in the past (actual tunnel interface or wildcard). We need to perform the steps all the time, now. That\u0027s why these lines were removed.",
