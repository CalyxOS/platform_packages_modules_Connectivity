      "message": "There may be more that needs to be done here. When this is called with `require`, a single IP rule is added. But if that single IP rule already exists because it was added as part of `setRequireVpnForUids`, as a result of lockdown being turned on VPN-wide, that means that if/when the VPN\u0027s lockdown mode is turned off, there will no longer be a rule for the UID.\n\nSo, we may need to interact with existing tracked state, e.g. `mVpnLockdownUidRangesProvidedVsEffectiveMap`, to make sure we are not adding something that is already present, and if we are, take steps to make sure it does not get removed later.",
