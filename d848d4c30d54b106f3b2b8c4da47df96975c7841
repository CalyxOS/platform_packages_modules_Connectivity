      "message": "This may not be best way to solve this, but it works.\n\nThere is another workaround which adds a updateRestrictedModeAllowlistUL call to updateNetworksInternal within the first synchronized block instead, but it\u0027s indirectly in response to a CONNECTIVITY_ACTION change and not called as early in the process, which may add a (small) window of opportunity for leakage. This change may do the same, but less -- not sure. Either way, it\u0027s not an indefinite leak like pre-patch.\n\nRequires changes to platform_frameworks_base as well.",
