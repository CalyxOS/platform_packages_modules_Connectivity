      "message": "Not fixed, based on daily driver use with raven for last few weeks. I\u0027m not sure why I thought it was fixed.\n\nAs before, Battery Saver continues to prevent apps from creating sockets (e.g. cannot enable SagerNet, \"operation not permitted\"), regardless of battery restriction settings.\n\nAdditionally, secondary user behavior *in general* would need to be checked more carefully before using this. That showed itself as an issue in regular use which went away after reboot (may have been related to battery saver or other things; unknown).",
