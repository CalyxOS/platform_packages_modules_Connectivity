      "message": "Still testing.\n\nAs complicated as this may look, the goal of this patch is merely to align the behavior of non-VPN ingress and egress traffic when \"Block connections without VPN\" is enabled, blocking inbound traffic when outbound would be blocked.\n\nIngress traffic from non-VPN interfaces could easily be blocked to all VPNs with the removal of a few lines of code from getVpnIsolationInterface, instead of all this, but sometimes the user may *want* it to be possible. This patch allows for that.",
