      "message": "Sorry, I think something is still missing (does not seem to handle some cases?) and this needs tests.\n\nJust realized I forgot to verify that the lockdown + VPN not established behavior is as expected (blocked), and in the process of checking that, the `adb shell dumpsys trafficcontroller` output seemed to show that toggling lockdown doesn\u0027t always change the allowed_iif for affected uids to change to the VPN\u0027s tun interface as it should, because I wasn\u0027t seeing it after multiple toggles off and on of lockdown. Not sure how to reproduce yet.",
