      "message": "Sorry, I think something is still missing (does not seem to handle some cases?) and this needs tests.\n\nJust realized I forgot to verify that the lockdown + VPN not established behavior is as expected (blocked), and in the process of checking that, the `adb shell dumpsys trafficcontroller` output seemed to show that toggling lockdown doesn\u0027t always change the allowed_iif for affected uids to change to the VPN\u0027s tun interface as it should, because I wasn\u0027t seeing it after multiple toggles off and on of lockdown. Not sure how to reproduce yet.",

Check that `adb shell dumpsys connectivity trafficcontroller | grep -E \u0027^\\s*[0-9]{5}\\s+.*LOCKDOWN` shows `tun` on end of lines; then check with `| grep -v tun` on the end and it should be totally empty (no output).\n3. If step 2 fails, we already have an issue, but re-establish the VPN within the app and test step 2 again. It should succeed.\n4. Toggle VPN\u0027s \"Always on\" setting off, then toggle it back and turn \"Block connections...\" (lockdown) back on, too.\n5. Perform step 2 again. It fails.",
