      "message": "It\u0027s not *too* far off, but they have moved/copied some things from C++ code to Java code (`addUidInterfaceRules`, `addRule` are implemented in both now). This patch also doesn\u0027t fully account for `PRE_T` devices, which they would need to consider if/when deploying any updates to the Connectivity module through Play, but which isn\u0027t relevant for CalyxOS.\n\nThey have also expanded on a comment in `requiresVpnAllowRule`, *possibly* doubling down on the current behavior (why???):\n```\n         // On T and above, allow rules are needed for all VPNs. Allow rule with null iface is a\n         // wildcard to allow apps to receive packets on all interfaces. This is required to accept\n         // incoming traffic in Lockdown mode by overriding the Lockdown blocking rule.\n```\n\nI could still try it though and see what happens!",
