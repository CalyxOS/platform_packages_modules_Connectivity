      "message": "Oliver, I\u0027m thinking maybe let\u0027s revisit this in December if possible. We can bring in some of the things we have learned from testing, and from AOSP\u0027s advice, *without* going as overboard as I did over there - goal being a patch as minimal as possible that still satisfies requirements. Current patchset I think has a few issues that we can address when we look into it; my patchsets are not reasonable as-is.",
